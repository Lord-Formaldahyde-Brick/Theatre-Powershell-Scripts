# Powershell-Scripts

Project to learn Powershell with the bonus that it will be useful in my work as a theatre sound engineer. People come in with playback tracks that range from video files (only for the sound??) to decent uncompressed PCM in little or big endian, and inconsistent sample rates. Often these tracks are jumping around in level too, which costs time to correct especially when shows have to be plotted in countable units of Planck time. The code will be updated when I learn new things in PS, (like replacing the Sed 'search and destroy' using PS string methods instead, if I can be bothered before moving on)
PS is quite strange after using C, JS and Bash for a long time. It has a familiar feel but will trip you up if you are too entrenched in the coding methods of the aforementioned.
Other scripts will be for theatre tech housekeeping and hopefully the code will improve with each script, with less reliance on utilities outside the Powershell environment.
And yes, the name of this repository has a typo... Ho-Hum!
