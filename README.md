# Powershell-Scripts

Project to learn Powershell and to be useful in my work as a theatre sound engineer. People come in with playback tracks that range from video (for the sound?) to decent uncompressed PCM in little or big endian. Often these tracks are jumping around in level too, which costs time to correct especially when shows have to be plotted in countable units of Planck time. The code will be updated when I learn new things in PS, (like replacing the Sed search and destroy using PS cmdlets instead)
PS feels quite strange after using C, JS and Bash for a long time. It has a familiar feel but will trip you up if you are too entrenched in the coding methods of the aforementioned.
